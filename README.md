# typescriptSnake
Recording my experiences with learning typescript

# version 1
After completeing https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript I tested myself by writing a version of snake without looking at any other implementations. 

The first version uses a coordinate system of game squares and the snake moves by providing coordinate updates, which are rendered by the canvas bpard view on a game loop, this gives a jerky 8 bit feel to the game.

Version 2 will change this mechanism to create a smoother feel, I'm also going to use webpack and try and fit some generics in there somewhere!
